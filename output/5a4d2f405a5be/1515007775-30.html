<p style="position:absolute;top:107px;left:11px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft07">Your Credit Score is a numerical representation of your credit worthiness that is used by most lenders and credit card issuers. Remember, Experian, Equifax, and <br>TransUnion each have their own set of data in your credit file. That's why Credit Scores may vary between bureaus.  </p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:523px;left:426px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft03">DISCLAIMER  </p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:556px;left:29px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft08">FICO Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by Experian is based on the FICO 8 scoring model and is powered by Experian <br>credit data. Many but not all lenders use the FICO 8 scoring model. <br> <br>There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and credit file. Your <br>lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO 8, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your associated risk level is often the <br>same even if the number is not. For some consumers, however, the risk assessment of FICO 8 could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements <br>that “90% of top lenders use FICO Scores” and “FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions” are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores <br>sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on the FICO 8 scoring model. <br> <br>FICO 8 scores range from 300 to 850. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk <br>to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk. There are three different major credit reporting agencies—Experian, <br>TransUnion and Equifax—that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit file at <br>the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the <br>agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your file can change over time, your FICO <br>Score may also change.  </p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:238px;left:31px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft09"><b>Your FICO Score powered by Experian data is formulated using the information in your credit file. Your FICO Score can range between <br>300 and 850, with a higher score indicating a lower risk. There are many scoring models used in the marketplace. The type of score <br>used, and its associated risk levels, may vary from lender to lender. But regardless of what scoring model is used, they all have one <br>purpose: to summarize your creditworthiness. Keep in mind that your score is just one factor used in the application process. Other <br>factors, such as your annual salary and length of employment, may also be considered by lenders when you apply for a loan.  </b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:351px;left:31px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft04"><b>What this means to you:  </b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:391px;left:31px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft09"><b>Credit scoring can help you understand your overall credit rating and help companies better understand how to serve you. Overall <br>benefits of credit scoring have included faster credit approvals, reduction in human error and bias, cinsistency, and better terms and <br>rates for American consumers through reduced costs and losses for lenders. While lenders may use different scoring modles to <br>determine how you score, and each major credit bureah has its own method for calculating credit scores, the scoring models have <br>been fairly well standardized so that a score at one bureau is roughly equivalent to the same score at another.  </b></p>
